- Emissions: None (no ongoing issuance).
- Burn/Deflation: None planned.
- Staking/Rewards: None.

## Acquisition

Current network availability: Ethereum Mainnet only.

1. Project Swap (planned)
   - We will launch our own swap to enable direct purchase of MVP on Ethereum Mainnet.
   - Liquidity seeded from treasury for core pairs (e.g., MVP/USDT).
2. Uniswap V4 (existing per site)
   - Connect wallet to Ethereum Mainnet
   - Prepare USDT and swap for MVP on Uniswap V4 via site link

Notes

- Bridging or deployment on MVP CHAIN is planned for a future phase; currently, MVP operates solely on Ethereum Mainnet.

Operational details (from site)

- Trading Pair: `MVP/USDT`
- Protocol: `Uniswap V4`
- Gas Fee: Paid in ETH on Ethereum Mainnet

Sources: https://mvpcha.in/ (Uniswap details); Project specification (own swap; mainnet-only).

## Network Context Relevant to Token

- Current network: Ethereum Mainnet
- Explorer: https://etherscan.io/address/0x88888888a98cb1525a98c354f17efc8d73ef07a6

Note: MVP CHAIN network details are tracked separately and are not yet active for the token.

## Risk and Compliance Notes

- As a gas-only utility token with fixed supply, economic risk is primarily market-driven (liquidity depth, swap price stability).
- Bridge and L3 operational risks remain (sequencer, DA, cross-chain bridge assumptions).
- No staking or governance reduces regulatory complexity but does not eliminate compliance requirements.
