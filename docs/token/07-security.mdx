- Privileges: admin/owner roles as discovered on Etherscan: **Not Public**; upgraders/timelocks if applicable: **Not Public**.
- Upgrade risk: **Proxy/Upgradeable (detected)**; pausable/blacklist: **Not Public**.
- Bridge risk: L1 custody/escrow and L3 minting introduce replay/censorship risks; users should verify bridge contracts.
