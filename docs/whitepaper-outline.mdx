# MVP Token (MVP) — Whitepaper Outline

This outline organizes the whitepaper and references supporting data gathered in:

- `mvp-chain/overview.md`
- `mvp-token/token-data.md`
- `mvp-token/mvp-swap-plan.md`

Sources: https://mvpcha.in/ (network details); Project specification (tokenomics and swap).

## 1. Abstract

- Summary of MVP CHAIN and MVP token’s purpose as gas-only utility with fixed supply and a dedicated project swap.

## 2. Introduction

- Motivation: Utility token exchanges (points, vouchers, rewards) need secure, fast, cheap settlement.
- Positioning: MVP CHAIN as a WorldChain L3 with Ethereum-security inheritance.

## 3. Network Overview

- Architecture: Optimistic Rollup, Fraud Proofs, Ethereum Settlement, Decentralized Sequencer, Data Availability.
- Performance: up to 10,000 TPS, less than 1s block time, instant finality.
- Costs: Low gas (e.g., ~0.01 Gwei observed; dynamic).
- Specs: Chain ID 480001, RPC `https://rpc.mvpcha.in`, EVM compatible.
- Reference: See `mvp-chain/overview.md`.

## 4. MVP Token Overview

- Role: Native gas token for MVP CHAIN.
- Standard: ERC-20 on Ethereum Mainnet (Decimals: 18).
- Availability: Ethereum Mainnet only (initial phase).
- Contract: `0x88888888a98Cb1525A98c354F17EFc8d73EF07A6` (Etherscan link in token docs).
- Reference: See `mvp-token/token-data.md`.

## 5. Token Utility

- Gas payments and network operations.
- No staking, rewards, or governance utility.

## 6. Token Economics

- Total Supply: 100,000,000 MVP (fixed cap).
- Emissions: None.
- Burns: None planned.
- Initial Mint: Minted to project treasury.
- Allocations: Liquidity provisioning for swap and operational reserves; no additional allocations.

## 7. Governance

- Token does not encode governance rights.
- Protocol governance (if any) is separate from token utility.

## 8. Technical Design Details

- Security assumptions (Optimistic Rollup, fraud proofs, settlement on Ethereum).
- Sequencer design and data availability.
- Cross-chain bridge design and trust model.

## 9. Bridge and Interoperability

- Current status: No bridge; MVP operates solely on Ethereum Mainnet.
- Future: Consider bridge to MVP CHAIN; document trust assumptions and UX when available.

## 10. MVP Swap (Project-owned)

- Purpose: Provide direct purchase path for MVP.
- Design: AMM-based DEX with core pairs (e.g., MVP/USDT).
- Liquidity: Seeded from treasury; fees and routing specifics to be defined.
- Deployment: Phase 1 on Ethereum Mainnet; Phase 2/3 consider MVP CHAIN.

## 11. Ecosystem and Use Cases

- Utility-token exchange scenarios (points, vouchers, rewards).
- Integrations and developer experience.

## 12. Roadmap

- Near-term: Launch project swap, seed liquidity, finalize bridge UX.
- Mid-term: Expand pairs, monitoring, tooling.

## 13. Risk, Compliance, and Disclosures

- Operational risks, bridge risks, protocol risks.
- Market and liquidity risks for swap.
- Regulatory and compliance considerations.
- Dynamic metrics disclaimer (gas, blocks) and validation steps.

## 14. References

- Official site: https://mvpcha.in/
- Explorer and developer docs (link as available).

Notes

- Project-defined sections reflect internal specifications and should be kept consistent with implementation details.
