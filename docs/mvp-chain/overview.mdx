# MVP CHAIN — Technical and Network Overview

Source: https://mvpcha.in/

## Summary
MVP CHAIN is a blockchain-powered utility token exchange that enables secure and efficient exchange of utility tokens (points, vouchers, rewards) using advanced blockchain technology. It is built as a Layer 3 (L3) on WorldChain Rollup, inheriting Ethereum’s security while providing enhanced performance and lower costs.

## Notes for Whitepaper Preparation
- All above information is extracted from the official MVP CHAIN website.
- Some specifics (e.g., token supply, distribution, governance, staking, exact contract addresses) are not listed on the public overview page and will need confirmation from technical docs, explorer, or official announcements.
- Always verify dynamic metrics (e.g., gas price, block numbers) and any external links (bridge, docs, explorer) at time of drafting.
