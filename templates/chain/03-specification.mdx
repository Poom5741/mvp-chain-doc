# Network Specifications

- Chain ID: **{{MVP_CHAIN_ID}}**
- RPC: `{{MVP_RPC}}`
- Explorer: `{{MVP_EXPLORER}}`
- Native Currency: **MVP**
- Bridge (L1→MVP CHAIN): ETH gas on L1, ~10 minutes
- Compatibility: EVM (Solidity, Web3)
- Current Status: **Mainnet**

## Execution & Compatibility

EVM‑compatible; supports Solidity toolchains and common libraries.

## Sequencer & Finality Model

Current: centralized sequencer with optimistic finality; failures may delay
inclusion. Target: increased decentralization and fault‑tolerance. Fallback:
transactions can be retried or routed via alternative gateways if provided.

## Data Availability & Proofs

Current DA: inherits from the parent rollup stack; settlement to L1 with
optimistic assumptions. Planned: upgrades to DA and proof systems as released
upstream.

## Bridging

Ethereum↔MVP CHAIN via bridge contracts; L1 fees in ETH; guidance ~10 minutes per
direction subject to L1 congestion.

## Performance Targets & Benchmarks

Targets only; independently verify before quoting. Throughput and latency depend
on upstream stack and sequencer parameters.
