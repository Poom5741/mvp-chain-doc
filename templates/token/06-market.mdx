# Market Microstructure

- Liquidity Sources: List known DEX/aggregators and L1 bridges (links only; no price commentary).
- Routing: L1 â†’ L3 via canonical/partner bridges; verify contract addresses.
- Venues: Centralized listings if any (links only). Avoid forward-looking claims.
- Monitoring: Prefer explorers and on-chain analytics; avoid unverifiable dashboards.

> Provide links to bridge/exchange docs and contract addresses. Do not include price or volume projections.
